### Outputs
When applied, the module exports the following outputs:

| Name        | Description                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `app_names` | Map of List of deployed application names |
| `provides`  | Map of `provides` endpoints               |
| `requires`  | Map of `requires` endpoints               |
| `offers`    | Map of List of offers by the deployment   |

Example output:
```
app_names = {
  "opensearch_main" = "opensearch-main"
  "opensearch_failover" = "opensearch-failover"
  "opensearch_apps" = ["data-hot-1", "ml", "data-cold"]
  "opensearch-dashboards" = "opensearch-dashboards"
  "self-signed-certificates" = "self-signed-certificates"
  "backups-integrator" = "s3-integrator"
  "data-integrator" = "data-integrator"
  "grafana-agent" = "grafana-agent"
}
offers = {
  "opensearch_main" = "..."
  "opensearch_failover" = "..."
  "certificates" = "..."
}
provides = {
  "cos_agent" = "cos-agent"
  "opensearch_client" = "opensearch-client"
  "peer_cluster_orchestrator" = "peer-cluster-orchestrator"
}
requires = {
  "certificates" = "certificates"
  "peer_cluster" = "opensearch-client"
  "s3_credentials" = "s3-credentials"
}
```

## Usage

This module is intended to be a product module, deploying all components for a proper and large opensearch deployment.

It may be used as-is and directly as follows:
```
tf init

tf plan \

tf plan \
  -var='main={"app_name": "main", "model": "dev"}' \
  -var='failover={"app_name": "failover", "model": "dev1"}' \
  -var='apps=[{"app_name": "data1", "model": "dev2"},{"app_name": "ml", "model": "dev2"}]' \
  -var='cluster_name=test' \
  -var='backups-integrator={"config": {"bucket": "bruv"}}' \
  -out=terraform.out

tf apply terraform.out
```
