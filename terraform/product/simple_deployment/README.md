|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| `opensearch`               | object <br/>(structure as defined in opensearch simple deployment input variables)                                                                            | OpenSearch main application              | **True** |
| `opensearch-dashboards`    | object <br/>(structure as defined in opensearch-dashboards input variables)                                                                                   | OpenSearch Dashboards application        | False    |
| `backups-integrator`       | object <br/>(structure as defined in the azure-storage/s3-integrator charms, with the addition of an attribute: <br/>- `storage_type` = "s3" or "azure" <br/> | Backup (s3/azure) integrator application | False    |
| `data-integrator`          | object <br/>(structure as defined in the data-integrator charm)                                                                                               | data-integrator application              | False    |
| `self-signed-certificates` | object <br/>(structure as defined in the self-signed-certificates charm)                                                                                      | self-signed-certificates application     | False    |
| `grafana-agent`            | object <br/>(structure as defined in the grafana-agent charm)                                                                                                 | grafana-agent application                | False    |


### Outputs
When applied, the module exports the following outputs:

| Name        | Description                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `app_names` | Map of List of deployed application names |
| `provides`  | Map of `provides` endpoints               |
| `requires`  | Map of `requires` endpoints               |

Example output:
```
app_names = {
  "backups-integrator" = "s3-integrator"
  "data-integrator" = "data-integrator"
  "grafana-agent" = "grafana-agent"
  "opensearch" = "opensearch"
  "opensearch-dashboards" = "opensearch-dashboards"
  "self-signed-certificates" = "self-signed-certificates"
}
offers = {}
provides = {
  "cos_agent" = "cos-agent"
  "opensearch_client" = "opensearch-client"
  "peer_cluster_orchestrator" = "peer-cluster-orchestrator"
}
requires = {
  "certificates" = "certificates"
  "peer_cluster" = "opensearch-client"
  "s3_credentials" = "s3-credentials"
}

```

## Usage

This module is intended to be a product module, deploying all components for a proper yet simple opensearch deployment.

It may be used as-is and directly as follows:
```
tf plan \
  -var='opensearch={"model": "dev"}' \
  -var='backups-integrator={"config": {"bucket": "mybucket"}}' \
  -out terraform.out
  
tf apply terraform.out
```
