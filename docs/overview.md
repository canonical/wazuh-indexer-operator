# Charmed Wazuh Indexer Documentation
<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->
The [Wazuh Indexer](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/wazuh-indexer/index.html) is a real-time,
full-text search and analytics engine for security data based on [OpenSearch](http://opensearch.org/).
Consequently, this charm is a Charmed [OpenSearch](https://github.com/canonical/opensearch-operator) fork.

When deployed and integrated with the [Wazuh Server charm](https://charmhub.io/wazuh-server),
the Wazuh Indexer charm expands the capabilities that the OpenSearch charm would provide. See the Server charm's documentation for more details. 

For the complete documentation, refer to [upstream](https://charmhub.io/opensearch).
